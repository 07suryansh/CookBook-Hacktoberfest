<h1> DNF SORT (Dutch National Flag)</h1>

There is an interesting programming technique that is used to solve problems in which an array consists of three numbers (usually 0, 1, and 2) and is widely used to
solve problems involving sequentially arranging three colours.
This programming problem was proposed by **Edsger Dijkstra.**

<h2> Why is it called DNF Sort ? </h2>
The flag of the Netherlands consists of three colors: white, red, and blue. <br>
The task is to randomly arrange balls of white, red, and blue such that balls of the same color are placed together.
