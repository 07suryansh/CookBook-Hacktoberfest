# Python

Python is a high-level general-purpose programming language. His design philosophy emphasizes code readability by using clear indentation. Python is dynamically typed and garbage collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (especially procedural), object-oriented, and functional programming. It is often referred to as a "batteries included" language due to its extensive standard library.
